<h1>Hello there!</h1>



My name is Petr Vesely, and I am a recent graduate of the applied informatics programme at the University of Hradec Kralove.<br>
So far I am using github mostly as a repository of the more interesting things whilst studying there, but (hopefully) more interesting things are coming in the future.
